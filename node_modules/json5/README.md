The JSON5 Data Interchange Format (JSON5) is a superset of [JSON] that aims to
alleviate some of the limitations of JSON by expanding its syntax to include
some productions from [ECMAScript 5.1].

This JavaScript library is the official reference implementation for JSON5
parsing and serialization libraries.
